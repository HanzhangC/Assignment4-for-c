In this code, I implemented a C program that reads event logs, analyzes sequences of actions, and discovers patterns in processes using dynamic memory and linked data structures. The program identifies and outputs sequential patterns, concurrency, and choice patterns from the input event logs, building a simple model that simulates real-world process discovery based on the input data.
